## My process

### Built with


- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I've learned

In this challenge I learned a lot about React and developed my skills with Java Script a lot, skills that I've been improving with similar projects lately, React has greatly improved website creation. Soon you can see the reason for being so famous, being this my project with API I looked for a lot of help and it was almost not possible to have the terminal without people, I hope to be able to continue my next possible projects on my own so I will probably study more reacting from now.
